# usePopcorn

## Overview

`usePopcorn` is a React application that allows users to search for movies by fetching data from the OMDb API. The app displays a list of search results, and users can click on any movie to view its details, including the movie poster, name, cast, crew, IMDb rating, and a rating field to add the movie to their watchlist along with a user-provided rating. Users cannot add a rating to the same movie again.

Once a movie is added to the watchlist, a summary of watched movies is displayed, showing the calculated average user ratings and average IMDb ratings of all the movies added to the watchlist by the user. The watchlist data is persisted to local storage, ensuring that the watchlist and summary of watched movies remain intact even after refreshing the app.
